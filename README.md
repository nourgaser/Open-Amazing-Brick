# Open Amazing Brick
A re-creation of the popular Amazing Brick game, made open source.

## Demo
A playable demo can be accessed through [here](https://oab.nourgaser.com).

## Notice
Music and game design copyrights go to the original creators of the game. I merely recreated the code as how I assume it originally looked like, as a game programming practice project.
